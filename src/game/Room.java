/**
 * Class Room - a room in an adventure game.
 *
 * This class is part of the "wfkkj4" application. 
 * "wfkkj4" is a simple text-based adventure game, based on the "World of Zuul" by Michael KÃ¶lling 
 * and David J. Barnes.
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game. It is connected to other rooms
 * via exits. For each existing exit, the room stores a reference to the neighboring room. It
 * also stores items. The room can be locked or not, and in case it is locked it can be unlocked.
